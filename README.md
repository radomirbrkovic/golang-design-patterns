 - **Creational patterns** provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. 
 - **Structural patterns** explain how to assemble objects and classes into large structures, while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.
 - **Behavioral patterns** take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
