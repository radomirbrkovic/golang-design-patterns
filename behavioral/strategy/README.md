# Strategy 

**Strategy** is a behavioral design pattern that turns a set of behaviors int objects and makes them interchangeable inside original context object. 

The original object, called context, holds a reference to a strategy object and delegates it executing the behavioral. In order to change the way the context preforms its work, other objects may replace the currently linked strategy object with another one.
