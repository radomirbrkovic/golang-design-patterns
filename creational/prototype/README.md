# Prototype

**Prototype** is a creational design pattern that allows cloning objects, even complex ones, without coupling their specific classes.

All prototype classes should have a common interface what makes it possible to copy objects even if their concrete classes are unknown. Prototype objects can produce full copies since objects of the same class can access each other's private fields.
