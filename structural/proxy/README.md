# Proxy

**Proxy** is a structural design pattern that provides an object that acts as a substitute for a real service object used by a client. A proxy receives  client request, does some work (access, control, catching, etc.) and then passes the request to a service object. 

The proxy object has the same interface as a service, which makes it interchangeable with a real object when passed to a client.
