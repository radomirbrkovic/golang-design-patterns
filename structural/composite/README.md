# Composite

**Composite** is a structural design pattern that allows composing objects into a tree-like structure and work with the it as if it was a singular object.

Composite becomes a pretty popular solution for the most problems that require building a tree structure. Composite's great feature is the ability to run methods recursively over the whole tree structure and sum up the result.
